		<b> CS Colloquium: </b>
		<p>The Computer Science Department sponsors a Friday colloquium series. The event is usually held in Room 100 of the Computer Science Building, but that location is subject to change. During the semester you are encouraged to attend these talks. You may obtain extra credit for the course by attending up to three of these presentations. Record your summary of each talk on the appropriate form and submit to Blackhawk.</p>
	    <b>Course Administration:</b>
		<p>Supplementary information for this course is available on Canvas. The class notes, PowerPoint slides, class announcements, the course syllabus, test dates, and other information for the course would be posted on Canvas. Each homework assignment and project will be made available through Canvas. You may find downloading the Canvas app to your smartphone as extremely helpful also. </p>
	    <b>Electronic Submission:</b>
		<p>Students bear sole responsibility for ensuring that assignments submitted electronically to an instructor are received in a timely manner and in the electronic format(s) specified by the instructor.  Students are also strongly advised to retain a copy of the dated submission.   </p>
	    <b>Late Submission:</b>
		<p>You are required to turn in all assignments, labs and projects, and no makeup work will be given. If you have an emergency beyond your control that prevents you from completing an assignment, you must notify the instructor within 24 hours or normal late penalties will apply. All homework, lab assignments and projects should be submitted by the end of the day on the due date.  Assignments received after 11:59 PM EDT on the due date are considered late.  The late penalty is 10% off each day.   Work which is more than five days late will receive a zero. If you have an emergency beyond your control that prevents you from completing an assignment, lab or project you must notify the instructor before the submission due date or normal late penalties will apply.</p>
		<b>Cell Phone Usage:</b>
		<p>Out of courtesy for all those participating in the learning experience, all cell phones must be turned off or placed in silent mode before entering the class.</p>
		<b>End-of-Semester Evaluation:</b>
		<p>In an ongoing effort to improve the quality of instruction, you are asked to complete a web-based course and instructor evaluation, to be administered during the last week of class. Students failing to submit the evaluation, will be assigned the grade of “<b>Incomplete.</b>”</p>
		<b>FERPA Disclaimer for Assessment:</b>
		<p><i>The College of Liberal Arts is keenly interested in assuring the quality and integrity of its General Education Program. Every semester, randomly-selected students from each General Education course will be required to submit samples of their work to an independent and objective assessment by faculty. No personally identifiable information about any student will be used for the purposes of this assessment, and assessment results will have no bearing whatsoever on student grades.</i></p>
