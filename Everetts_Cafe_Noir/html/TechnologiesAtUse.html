    <h1>Technolgies At Use</h1>
    <p class = "talkingtext" >Examples of some of the information technology we use mainly include a voluntary database where, with every customer order, we save their orders within a database on a private server. <br> The customer can use our phone app to link their name to a credit or debit card.<br> They can customize and save their orders, as well as be able to see what they order the most from our store.<br> This process can initially cause a more extended wait time whenever a customer first comes in, as they need to be set up in our system first.<br> If the customer uses our app, we can have lightning fast orders, as with the press of a button.<br> The customer would give their name at the beginning of the order process and would be able to say their custom order name.<br> This process would make orders faster than just looking at the menu and ordering from it.<br> This system also allows requests to be pre-made and pre-paid for, so the customer can run in quickly grab their drink at a given time using our system.<br> The online orders will pop up on a screen below the counter to provide a better aesthetically pleasing look to our shop.<br>
